# rad-coolify-orchestrator — Deploy, manage, and troubleshoot self-hosted apps on Coolify — from Claude Code.

Coolify is a self-hosted Heroku/Netlify alternative with its own patterns for Dockerfiles, environment variables, Traefik (or Caddy) routing, and rolling deployments. rad-coolify-orchestrator teaches Claude those patterns so you're not guessing at configuration or debugging 502s without a clear mental model. Plus it ships **four Python validators** that catch the patterns the LLM reviewer can miss when eyeballing files.

## Read this first: scope and honest framing

- **Self-hosted only.** All content assumes self-hosted Coolify v4.x. **Coolify Cloud** (managed control plane, $5/month + $3/month per server, launched 2025) is a different product — many things differ.
- **Coolify v4 is a rolling beta.** Latest as of April 2026 is `v4.0.0-beta.474` (~474 betas over 2 years). The v4.0.0 stable milestone hasn't been closed. Treat the API and UI as evolving — pin to a specific Coolify version for production automation.
- **No Kubernetes support.** Plugin covers Coolify's actual orchestration: single-server (default) and Docker Swarm (experimental in Coolify, but Swarm itself is supported by Mirantis through 2030).
- **Sentinel is a metrics side-car, not full observability.** CPU/RAM/disk/network only. No log aggregation, no tracing, no APM. Add Grafana+Prometheus or external APM for real observability.
- **"Zero-downtime" deploys have conditions** — single-container only (not docker-compose), no host port bindings, working healthcheck, volumes attachable to multiple containers. When conditions fail, Coolify falls back to recreate strategy (brief downtime).

## What you can do with this

- Deploy an application to Coolify with the right build pack and health check configuration
- Diagnose 502/504 errors, failed deployments, and Traefik routing issues with a structured approach
- Set up environment variables and secrets without exposing them in Dockerfiles or build logs (with mechanism — `check-coolify-env.py` actually scans for hardcoded secrets)
- Configure CI/CD pipelines that trigger Coolify deployments from GitHub Actions (with mechanism — `audit-cicd.py` catches missing `--fail`, exposed tokens)
- Have Claude run live operational queries against your Coolify instance (via the bundled MCP server)

## How it works

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `coolify-deploy` | Build packs (Nixpacks/Static/Dockerfile/Compose), Caddy alternative proxy, deployment configuration, rolling updates with honest conditions |
| `coolify-databases` | One-click engines (PostgreSQL 13-18, MySQL, MariaDB, MongoDB, Redis, KeyDB, Dragonfly, ClickHouse), backups, restore, connection patterns |
| `coolify-security` | Secrets management, BuildKit secrets, RBAC, **shared variables (server/team/project/environment scopes — new in beta.471)** |
| `coolify-cicd` | GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, REST API (with stability caveats), webhooks (GET canonical), token expiration, HMAC signing |
| `coolify-infrastructure` | Multi-server, Docker Swarm (experimental, with bug notes), build servers |
| `coolify-observability` | Sentinel (honest scope: metrics side-car only), notification channels, log drains (Axiom, Loki, New Relic, FluentBit), Uptime Kuma |
| `coolify-troubleshoot` | 502/504 diagnosis, Traefik routing, container failures, deployment errors, SSL issues |
| `coolify-actions` | MCP-based operational actions against a live Coolify instance — uses the bundled `@radoriginllc/coolify-mcp` (27 tools) |

| Agent | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `coolify-reviewer` | Reviews Coolify configs, Dockerfiles, compose, env, and CI/CD. **2.0: runs 4 Python validators first (mechanism), then applies LLM judgment to what scripts can't see.** Opus 4.7 default. |

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scripts/lint-dockerfile.py` | Coolify-specific Dockerfile linter — unpinned base images, missing USER/EXPOSE/HEALTHCHECK, secret-shaped ARGs/ENVs, single-stage warning |
| `scripts/lint-compose.py` | Coolify-specific compose validator — missing healthchecks/restart, hardcoded secrets, privileged mode, port conflicts with Coolify reserved ports (80/443/8000), stateful services without volumes |
| `scripts/check-coolify-env.py` | Env handling — `.env` in git, `.gitignore` gaps, hardcoded secrets across files, Nixpacks version-pin gap |
| `scripts/audit-cicd.py` | CI/CD validator — curl without `--fail`, hardcoded webhook URLs/tokens, `:latest` tags, missing test gate, missing post-deploy status check |

All scripts are pure Python 3.8+ stdlib. No `pip install` required.

## What's NEW in 2.0

### Mechanism (4 Python validators)
The `coolify-reviewer` agent now runs four scripts as Step 0 before LLM judgment. Same pattern as rad-planner's `risk-assessor` + `plan-lint.py`. Converts "I'll check your Dockerfile" from LLM eyeballing to deterministic Python — saves tokens, gives reproducible results, and lets the LLM focus on what scripts can't see (semantic healthcheck quality, cross-file consistency, intent).

### Honest framing updates
- **Nixpacks is in maintenance mode** (Railway moved focus to Railpack in 2025) — flagged in `build-packs.md`. Practical impact: very recent runtime versions (Node 24+) may not be available; use Dockerfile as the escape hatch.
- **Railpack is NOT yet a Coolify build pack option** — earlier docs implied it was available with opt-in. Reality: active community discussion (#5282, #5519, #7983), no merged PR. Plugin now states this clearly.
- **Caddy added as experimental alternative proxy** (beta.237) — `coolify-deploy` SKILL now mentions both options with caveats.
- **"Zero-downtime"** reframed with explicit conditions in `coolify-deploy` SKILL.
- **Sentinel** explicitly framed as metrics side-car (not observability solution) in `coolify-observability` SKILL.
- **API stability** caveats added to `coolify-cicd` reference (Issues #7702, #8782 — spec-vs-behavior gaps).
- **Coolify v4 is rolling beta** — explicit in deploy SKILL; pin Coolify version for production automation.

### Updates for new Coolify features (2025-2026)
- Shared variables expanded to **four scopes** (server/team/project/environment) with `{{scope.VAR}}` interpolation syntax (beta.471, April 2026) — documented in `coolify-security`.
- **API token expiration** (beta.474) — documented in `coolify-cicd/api-reference.md`.
- **PostgreSQL 18 + pgvector 18** (beta.463, Feb 2026) — added to `coolify-databases`.
- **Webhook canonical method is GET** (per Coolify's own docs); POST also works. Both forms documented in `coolify-cicd`.
- **HMAC webhook signing strengthened** (beta.474) — noted in `coolify-cicd`.
- **Old container accumulation in Swarm rolling updates** (Issue #8299, Feb 2026) — bug noted in `swarm-guide.md`.

### Platform pass
- `coolify-reviewer` agent: **Opus 4.7 default** with Sonnet 4.6 fallback note
- Mechanism-first execution model documented
- JSON output mode for skill consumption alongside markdown for human reading

## What this plugin does NOT do

- **Does not cover Coolify Cloud** — managed product is out of scope
- **Does not provide Kubernetes support** — Coolify itself doesn't support K8s; plugin covers actual options (single-server, Swarm-experimental)
- **Does not promise zero-downtime** — surfaces the conditions, you assess if your setup meets them
- **Does not validate deployment will succeed** — catches *patterns* that lead to failures; the actual deploy still has to work
- **Does not connect to your live Coolify** by itself — the bundled MCP server (`coolify-actions` skill) does that with your `COOLIFY_URL` + `COOLIFY_API_TOKEN`
- **Does not auto-fix issues** — reviews and reports; you decide what to change

## Quick Start

```bash
claude plugins add ./RAD-Claude-Skills/plugins/rad-coolify-orchestrator
```

### Bundled MCP server (verified — 27 tools)
