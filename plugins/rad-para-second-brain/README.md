# rad-para-second-brain — An AI that actively manages your PARA second brain. Not just knowledge about it.

Most PARA tools tell you about the methodology. rad-para-second-brain implements it for you — organizing notes, running weekly reviews, distilling raw captures into usable knowledge, and maintaining continuity between sessions via the Hemingway Bridge pattern. Based on Tiago Forte's Building a Second Brain.
