# Session Startup

Orient a new session by reading the handoff state left by `/wrapup`, detecting the project type, discovering available resources, and presenting a concise briefing.

**This skill is read-only. It never creates, modifies, or deletes files.**

**Cross-model note.** Works identically across Opus 4.7, Sonnet 4.6, and Haiku 4.5. Opus/Sonnet should batch Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 2.5 reads into a single parallel tool-call burst (see "Execution" below). Haiku may follow phase order sequentially if parallel batching misbehaves. Output briefing format is identical regardless of model.

---

## Execution: parallel-first

The phases below are written sequentially for readability, but the work inside Phases 1, 2, and 2.5 has **no inter-phase dependencies** — every read and every shell command can be issued as a single parallel batch. Opus 4.7 and Sonnet 4.6 should do exactly that. The only sequential step is Phase 3 (briefing synthesis), which depends on the results.

**Batch to issue at the start of the skill:**

- Read `CLAUDE.md`, `HANDOFF.md`, `.claude/session-log.md` (Phase 1.1–1.3)
- Read `.mcp.json`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.env.example`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml` (if any exist — Phase 2.5)
- Glob for stack marker files (Phase 2.5.2)
- Bash: `git status --short`, `git log --oneline -5`, `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`, `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...@{upstream}` — run as one combined command so the shell spawn cost is paid once (Phase 2.2)

If a file is missing, the corresponding Read call will error silently — that's fine, skip its content in the briefing. Do not re-attempt serial reads after a parallel batch.

---

## Phase 1: Discover Project State

Read handoff files. All are optional — skip silently if missing.

### 1.1 Read CLAUDE.md + resolve imports

Read `CLAUDE.md` at the project root. Note:
- Project name and type
- Tech stack
- Key conventions and rules

**Import resolution.** If CLAUDE.md contains lines matching `@<path>` (e.g., `@docs/architecture.md`, `@.claude/rules.md`), treat each as an imported file. Resolve each path relative to the CLAUDE.md location and Read the file in the same parallel batch. Include the imported content as additional project context in the briefing when relevant. Missing import targets are reported silently (note in the briefing under a subtle "⚠ missing import: <path>" line — do not error out).

Do not follow imports recursively beyond one level — that is Claude Code's native Auto Memory behavior, and re-implementing it here risks divergence.

### 1.2 Read HANDOFF.md

Read `HANDOFF.md` at the project root. This is the primary handoff from the last session. Extract:
- Status line
- Where work was left off
- Key decisions from last session
- "What NOT To Do" traps (TRIED / FAILED BECAUSE / CORRECT APPROACH — see `references/handoff-template.md`)
- Open work items
- Modified files
- Key insights

### 1.3 Read Session Log

Read `.claude/session-log.md` if it exists. Focus on the most recent 3–5 entries for:
- Patterns across sessions (recurring traps, ongoing work threads)
- Context that the latest HANDOFF.md alone might not capture
- How long the current work has been in progress

### 1.4 Assess Handoff Freshness — with auto-refresh for stale handoffs

Check the date in HANDOFF.md against today's date:

- **Same day or yesterday:** Handoff is fresh — trust it fully.
- **2–7 days old:** Handoff is recent — trust it but note the gap.
- **7+ days old:** Handoff is stale. **Before presenting the briefing**, run an auto-refresh:
  1. `git log --oneline --since="<handoff date>" 2>/dev/null`
  2. `git diff --stat <commit-at-handoff-date>..HEAD 2>/dev/null` if resolvable, else skip
  3. Synthesize a one-paragraph "Changes since last session" block summarizing commits that weren't authored during a Claude Code session (i.e., commits not referenced in HANDOFF.md's "Modified Files" list).
  4. Include the synthesized block in the briefing under a `Changes since last session (outside Claude Code):` heading, and lead the briefing with a one-line staleness note: `⚠ Handoff is N days old — auto-refreshed from git log.`
- **No HANDOFF.md:** Note this is either a brand-new project or one that hasn't used `/wrapup` yet — fall through to the Minimal Briefing.

---

## Phase 2: Detect Project Type

### 2.1 Project Type Detection

Use Glob to check for coding-project indicators (any of these):

```
package.json
Cargo.toml
pyproject.toml
go.mod
Makefile
*.sln
.git/
```

**Non-coding project:** none detected. Note this — the briefing drops git info.

### 2.2 Live State (Coding Projects Only)

Run as a single combined command:

```bash
git status --short 2>/dev/null && echo "---" && \
git log --oneline -5 2>/dev/null && echo "---" && \
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null && echo "---" && \
git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...@{upstream} 2>/dev/null
```

Capture: current branch, uncommitted changes, recent commits, ahead/behind vs. remote.

### 2.3 Detect Changes Since Last Session

If HANDOFF.md has a date and no stale-refresh was triggered in Phase 1.4, spot-check for commits between the handoff date and now that aren't referenced in the handoff's Modified Files list. If found, flag them in the briefing as "changes made outside the last session."

---

## Phase 2.5: Resource Discovery

Detect project-specific resources so Claude doesn't need to be reminded every session. All steps are read-only and issued in the parallel batch from "Execution." Skip silently when nothing is found.

### 2.5.1 MCP Servers

Read `.mcp.json` at the project root if it exists. Parse the JSON and extract the keys under `mcpServers`.

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "supabase": {...}, "coolify": {...} } }
```
→ `MCPs: supabase, coolify`

Also read `.claude/settings.json` and collect names under `enabledMcpjsonServers` or plugin-scoped MCP entries. Merge without duplication. Malformed JSON → skip silently.

### 2.5.2 Stack CLIs (inferred from marker files)

Glob the project root for these markers. File-presence inference only — **never exec any binary**.

| Marker file(s) | Implied CLI |
|----------------|-------------|
| `supabase/config.toml` | `supabase` |
| `wrangler.toml`, `wrangler.jsonc` | `wrangler` |
| `netlify.toml` | `netlify` |
| `vercel.json` | `vercel` |
| `fly.toml` | `flyctl` |
| `firebase.json` | `firebase` |
| `.github/workflows/` (any *.yml) | `gh` |
| `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `compose.yaml` | `docker` |
| `coolify.json`, `.coolify/` | Coolify deploy target |
| `terraform/`, `*.tf` | `terraform` |
| `pulumi.yaml` | `pulumi` |
| `pyproject.toml` + `poetry.lock` | `poetry` |
| `Pipfile` | `pipenv` |
| `requirements.txt` (no poetry/pipenv) | `pip` |
| `Gemfile` | `bundle` |
| `deno.json`, `deno.jsonc` | `deno` |
| `bun.lockb`, `bunfig.toml` | `bun` |
| `Cargo.toml`, `rust-toolchain.toml` | `cargo` |
| `go.mod` | `go` |
| `mise.toml`, `.mise.toml` | `mise` |
| `.tool-versions` | `asdf` |
| `flake.nix`, `shell.nix` | `nix` |
| `devbox.json` | `devbox` |

Collect into a deduplicated list.

### 2.5.3 Package Manager & Scripts

If `package.json` exists:

- Read `packageManager` field (e.g., `pnpm@9.0.0`). If absent, infer from lockfile: `pnpm-lock.yaml` → pnpm, `yarn.lock` → yarn, `bun.lockb` → bun, else npm.
- Extract top 5–8 keys from `scripts`. Prefer in this order if present: `dev`, `build`, `test`, `typecheck`, `lint`, `start`, `check`, `format`.

Output example: `Scripts (pnpm): dev, build, test, typecheck, lint`

For Python: if `pyproject.toml` has a `[tool.poetry.scripts]` or `[project.scripts]` table, list up to 5 entries as `Scripts (poetry): ...`. For other non-Node stacks, skip unless trivially obvious.

### 2.5.4 Environment Template

If `.env.example` exists, read it and extract **variable names only** (everything before `=` on each non-comment line). **Never read `.env` or any file that may contain real values.**

Output: `Env template: SUPABASE_URL, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, ... (.env.example)`

### 2.5.5 CLAUDE.md Resources Section

If CLAUDE.md contains a heading matching any of these (case-insensitive), extract its contents verbatim:

- `## Resources`
- `## MCP` / `## MCPs`
- `## Tools` / `## CLI Tools`

Treat the extracted contents as the **documented** source of truth for this project.

### 2.5.6 Reconciliation

Compare documented (2.5.5) against detected (2.5.1–2.5.4):

- **Documented + detected** → show normally in "Resources available."
- **Documented but not detected** → show with `⚠ documented but not found` — possible drift (config moved, tool uninstalled).
- **Detected but not documented** → show under a secondary line `Also detected (not in CLAUDE.md):` — signals the user may want to run `/add-resource` to register them.

If no CLAUDE.md Resources section exists, treat all detected items as primary with no drift warnings.

---

## Phase 3: Orient and Brief

Present a concise, scannable session briefing. Adapt the format based on what's available. Full example briefings (full, minimal, non-coding) are in `references/briefing-examples.md` — follow those structures verbatim.

### Briefing selection

| Condition | Template |
|-----------|----------|
| HANDOFF.md exists + coding project | Full Briefing (see `references/briefing-examples.md`) |
| No HANDOFF.md | Minimal Briefing |
| No build-system markers | Non-Coding Briefing |

### Presentation rules

- Keep the briefing **under 35 lines** — this is a quick orientation, not a report.
- Use the **exact wording from HANDOFF.md** for traps and open work — don't paraphrase. The original wording was chosen carefully and paraphrasing often loses the load-bearing detail.
- End with `Ready to continue. What would you like to work on?` to hand control back.
- If the handoff is **stale (7+ days)**, lead with the staleness + auto-refresh note before the briefing body.
- **Omit** the "Resources available" block entirely if every category (MCPs, CLIs, scripts, env) is empty — don't show an empty header.
- Cap the Resources block at **6 lines**; truncate with `...` if a category has more than 8 items.
- If imports were resolved in Phase 1.1 and surfaced non-trivial content (e.g., architecture notes not in CLAUDE.md body), add a single `Imports: <file1>, <file2>` line under the Resources block.
