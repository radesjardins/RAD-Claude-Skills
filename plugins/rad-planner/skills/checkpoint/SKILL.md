# Checkpoint — Document & Clear Context Management

Preserve the current session state so work can be resumed in a fresh session without loss. This implements the "Document & Clear" pattern, which mitigates context rot — the observed degradation of AI reasoning quality as context windows fill. The skill updates plan task states and writes planner run state; the user runs `/clear` and starts the new session themselves. Nothing here is automatic.

**HANDOFF.md is owned by rad-session `/wrapup`** per the single-writer rule (see `docs/doc-conventions.md` → canonical at `docs/doc-conventions.md`). `/checkpoint` does **not** write HANDOFF.md in 3.0 and later. If you want a session-level handoff document, run `/rad-session:wrapup` either before or after `/checkpoint`. The two are complementary:

- `/checkpoint` saves **planner-skill run state** — the bookkeeping for resuming `/plan`, `/review-plan`, or `/evaluate-stack` mid-flight.
- `/rad-session:wrapup` saves **session state** — HANDOFF.md, session-log entry, optional DECISIONS.md prompt, optional CLAUDE.md prune.

Checkpoint at milestone boundaries, after 2 consecutive failures, or when context degradation signs appear (vague responses, hallucinated paths, correction loops). See `references/context-management.md` for the full trigger matrix and the shared checkpoint schema.

For a quick read of *where you are* in an in-flight plan without writing a checkpoint, use `/rad-planner:status` instead.

## Cross-model note

This skill works identically across Opus 4.7, Sonnet 4.6, and Haiku 4.5. The git state capture and run-state file generation are deterministic; parallel Reads of the plan file plus `git status` / `git log` are independent and should be batched.

## Execution: parallel-first

Step 1's reads — implementation plan file (PLAN.md or `tasks.md`), `git status`, `git log --oneline -5`, `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` — are all independent. Batch into a single parallel burst. Only serialize when Step 3's plan update requires the prior read's contents.

## Checkpoint Workflow

### Step 1: Assess Current State (parallel batch)

Read the implementation plan (if one exists — typically `PLAN.md` in 3.0+, or `implementation_plan.md` in legacy projects) and run git commands in parallel. Capture:
- What phase/milestone are we in?
- Which tasks are completed, in progress, or blocked?
- What files were modified in this session?
- Are there any uncommitted changes?
- Current branch, recent commits, ahead/behind vs. remote

### Step 2: Write Planner State File (if run-id is available)

If `--run-id <id>` is provided, or if a prior `plan` / `review-plan` / `evaluate-stack` run is in progress, write/update the planner state file at `.planner/state/<run-id>.json` per the shared schema in `references/context-management.md`. This lets the next session resume the specific skill that was in flight via `--resume <run-id>`.

The shared schema allows the `plan`, `review-plan`, and `evaluate-stack` skills to all use the same state file format — different `skill` values, same structure.

If no run-id is in flight, skip this step and proceed to Step 3.

### Step 3: Update the Plan

If an implementation plan exists (`PLAN.md` or `tasks.md`), update task states:
- Mark completed tasks as `[DONE]` or `[VERIFIED]`
- Mark the current task as `[IN PROGRESS]`
- Update any dependency states that changed

### Step 4: Recommend Next Steps

Tell the user:

```
Checkpoint complete. Planner state saved to .planner/state/<run-id>.json[ and PLAN.md tasks updated].

To continue in a fresh session:
1. (Recommended) Run /rad-session:wrapup first to capture session-level state in HANDOFF.md
2. Start a new Claude Code session (or run /clear)
3. Run /rad-session:startup — it reads HANDOFF.md + session-log and orients you
   OR if a run-id was saved: "/rad-planner:plan --resume <run-id>"
4. The fresh session will have a clean context window

If you skipped step 1 (no /wrapup), the next /startup will only have the planner
state file plus git history to work from — usually enough for plan-level
resumption but missing session-level context like "what NOT to retry."

If you want to continue in this session instead, that's fine —
but be aware that context quality may degrade as the session gets longer.
```

## What Gets Preserved

| What | Where | Why |
|------|-------|-----|
| Active skill run state | `.planner/state/<run-id>.json` | Resume specific skill via `--resume` |
| Task states | `PLAN.md` / `tasks.md` | Track completion |
| Git state | Captured at checkpoint time, surfaced in output | Know what's committed vs. uncommitted at the moment of /checkpoint |

## What `/checkpoint` does NOT preserve

- **HANDOFF.md** — that's rad-session `/wrapup`'s job (single-writer rule).
- **Session log entry** — rad-session `/wrapup`'s job.
- The full conversation history (that's the point — we're clearing it).
- Intermediate reasoning or exploration results (externalize important findings to DECISIONS.md or PLAN.md).
- Temporary debugging context (capture only the solution, not the journey).
