# Stack Evaluation Subagent Prompt

Template for dispatching the `stack-advisor` agent from a skill. Substitute the `{placeholder}` tokens before passing to the `Agent` tool.

**Cross-model note.** This prompt is neutral across Opus 4.7 / Sonnet 4.6 / Haiku 4.5. The agent is defined with `model: opus` because cross-layer stack evaluation with live version verification rewards careful multi-dimensional reasoning. Sonnet is a first-class fallback. Output is JSON-first (see `## Output Format` below) so downstream parsing is robust across model variance.

---

## Prompt Body

```
You are the Stack Advisor. Evaluate and recommend a technology stack for the project below,
grounded in the Golden Path matrix at `references/golden-path-matrix.md` and verified against
current information via WebSearch / Context7.

## Project Context
{project_context}

## Mode
{mode}  # one of: new_project | evaluate_existing | compare_frameworks

## Existing Stack (if mode=evaluate_existing)
{existing_stack_json_or_none}

## Frameworks to Compare (if mode=compare_frameworks)
{frameworks_to_compare_or_none}

## Evaluation Scope
For each layer, document: choice, version, AI proficiency tier, rationale, alternatives considered.

Layers to evaluate:
- Language (TypeScript is the default unless project requires otherwise)
- Frontend framework
- Backend framework/runtime
- Database system
- ORM / data access layer
- Styling approach
- Authentication
- Deployment platform
- Key supporting libraries

## Execution: parallel-first
Issue independent WebSearch / WebFetch calls in parallel batches (version checks, release-cadence
checks, and security advisory checks across different frameworks have no inter-dependency). Only
serialize when a later search depends on a prior finding.

## Output Format — JSON-first

Emit a SINGLE JSON code block matching the schema below. A short human-readable summary MAY
follow the JSON block, but the JSON is authoritative and is what the skill parses.

```json
{
  "evaluation_complete": true,
  "project_type": "string — e.g., 'startup MVP', 'AI-native', 'enterprise', 'content site'",
  "summary": "string — 2–3 sentences",
  "recommendation": [
    {
      "layer": "string — e.g., 'Frontend', 'Database'",
      "choice": "string",
      "version": "string — specific version or semver range",
      "ai_tier": "Primary | Secondary | Niche | Data",
      "rationale": "string"
    }
  ],
  "alternatives_considered": [
    {"layer": "string", "alternative": "string", "why_rejected": "string"}
  ],
  "compatibility_verified": true,
  "compatibility_notes": ["string — findings from cross-layer checks"],
  "risks": [
    {"risk": "string", "mitigation": "string"}
  ],
  "version_pins": {"package_name": "version_spec"},
  "verification_sources": [{"title": "string", "url": "string", "checked_on": "ISO-8601"}],
  "confidence": "high | medium | low",
  "escalation_required": false,
  "escalation_reason": ""
}
```

### Escalation behavior
Set `escalation_required: true` when:
- The project's requirements fundamentally conflict (e.g., "must be fully static" + "must support real-time collaboration")
- No Primary/Secondary-tier option exists for a required constraint
- Live verification reveals all plausible candidates have active breaking-change migrations

Populate `escalation_reason` with a specific description. The calling skill surfaces this to
the user rather than forcing a recommendation.

After the JSON block, optionally include a ≤150-word human summary.

## Rules
- TypeScript is the default language unless the project specifically requires otherwise
- Primary/Secondary tier first; justify any Niche/Legacy choice explicitly
- Every recommendation must have a verified version (not "latest")
- Note uncertainty explicitly — don't over-claim when live verification was inconclusive
- Don't recommend more tools than necessary — every addition is complexity
- Don't ignore existing infrastructure when mode=evaluate_existing
```

## Markdown fallback

If JSON emission fails (model variance), the legacy markdown `## Stack Recommendation` structure from `agents/stack-advisor.md` is an acceptable fallback. Skills detect missing JSON and parse markdown as best-effort.
