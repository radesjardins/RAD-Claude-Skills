# RAD Code Review

**3-role adversarial review with diff-aware scoping and AI slop detection — the only code reviewer that catches what AI wrote badly and only flags what you changed.**

## What's New in v2.0

| Feature | v1.0 | v2.0 |
|---------|------|------|
| **Diff-aware scoping** | Reviews all files in scope, flags everything | Blame-aware by default for diff/commit scopes — only flags issues on changed lines |
| **Incremental review** | `diff`, `commit`, `repo`, `tree` | + `--since <commit>` for reviewing changes across multiple commits |
| **IDOR detection** | Conceptual checklist | Framework-specific grep-able heuristics for Next.js, Express, Fastify, Django, Rails, Go |
| **Performance detection** | "Check for N+1 queries" | Concrete patterns: N+1 inside loops, re-render triggers, unbounded lists, sync blocking, bundle bloat |
| **Accessibility** | WCAG checklist | + Dynamic ARIA state detection (hardcoded `aria-expanded`, `aria-selected`, etc.) |
| **Adversarial pass** | Challenges findings | + Validates blame-scoping decisions (no false filtering) |
| **Finding attribution** | All findings equal | Each finding tagged `introduced` vs `pre-existing-dependency` |

## Why This Exists

AI-generated code compiles, passes basic tests, and looks correct at a glance. But it has measurable quality issues: hallucinated APIs, shallow error handling, missing edge cases, copy-paste patterns that diverge, IDOR vulnerabilities that pass code review, and N+1 queries that work in dev but crash in production.

RAD Code Review is the harsh reviewer that runs AFTER the build phase. It is intentionally adversarial — it assumes the code is wrong and looks for proof. When it finds nothing, that is a meaningful signal.

**v2.0 adds diff-awareness** so it works naturally in PR workflows. You don't want 50 findings about pre-existing tech debt when you're reviewing a 3-file PR. You want to know: "Did I introduce any problems?"

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/radesjardins/RAD-Claude-Skills.git
cd RAD-Claude-Skills

# Install as a plugin
claude plugins add ./plugins/rad-code-review
```

### Usage

```bash
# Review your current diff (blame-aware — only flags your changes)
/rad-code-review diff

# Review changes since a specific commit
/rad-code-review --since abc123

# Review last commit before merging
/rad-code-review commit

# Full repository audit (no blame filtering)
/rad-code-review repo

# Override blame-aware default — flag everything in the diff
/rad-code-review diff --full-scan

# Strict mode for public release
/rad-code-review repo --strictness public

# Dual-engine adversarial review
/rad-code-review diff --engine both
```

Or just say it naturally:

```
Review my PR
Is this ready to ship?
Check what I changed for security issues
Review changes since last release
```

### Review Scopes

| Scope | What It Reviews | Blame-Aware | When To Use |
|-------|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| `diff` | Staged/unstaged changes | Yes (default) | PR review, quick check |
| `commit` | HEAD commit | Yes (default) | Post-merge verification |
| `--since <commit>` | All changes since commit | Yes (default) | Sprint review, release delta |
| `tree` | Working tree changes | No (full scan) | Before committing |
| `repo` | Entire repository | No (full scan) | Initial audit, periodic deep review |

### Blame-Aware Mode

When reviewing a diff or commit, v2.0 only flags issues on lines you changed. This means:

- **Introduced issues**: Problems in your changed code. Always flagged.
- **Pre-existing dependencies**: If your new code calls an existing function that has a vulnerability, it's flagged with `[PRE-EXISTING]` tag and explains the dependency chain.
- **Suppressed**: Pre-existing code quality issues unrelated to your changes. Not flagged.
- **Override**: Use `--full-scan` to see everything, like v1.0.

### Strictness Levels

| Level | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `mvp` | Focus on blockers and critical bugs. Skip style, docs, minor issues. Fast. |
| `production` | Full review across all 12 dimensions. Default. |
| `public` | Everything in production plus: public API surface, docs completeness, license compliance, security hardening. |

### Engine Options

| Engine | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `claude` | Single-pass review using Claude. Default. |
| `codex` | Single-pass review using Codex. |
| `both` | Sequential adversarial: Claude reviews first, then Codex challenges findings and hunts for what was missed. |

## What It Reviews

### Three Roles, Every Run

1. **Bug Finder** — Functional defects, logic errors, race conditions, edge cases, unhandled errors, and 14 AI slop patterns (hallucinated imports, fake error handling, placeholder stubs, silent failures, cargo-cult patterns, and more).

2. **Architecture Reviewer** — Structure, coupling, naming, abstraction quality, test coverage gaps, performance anti-patterns (N+1 queries, unbounded lists, sync blocking, bundle bloat), and maintainability.

3. **Release Gate** — Security (OWASP + framework-specific IDOR for 6 frameworks), accessibility (WCAG 2.2 + dynamic ARIA state detection), license compliance, dependency vulnerabilities, secret exposure, and documentation completeness.

### 12 Review Dimensions

Functional correctness, security, AI slop detection, architecture, tests, performance, UI/UX, accessibility, release readiness, documentation, dependencies, privacy/secrets handling.

### 8 Project-Type Modules

Web app, API/backend, Chrome extension, CLI tool, library/package, Electron app, mobile (React Native/Flutter), SaaS platform.

## Features

- **Blame-aware diff scoping** (v2.0) — only flag issues you introduced, with dependency chain detection
- **Incremental `--since` review** (v2.0) — review changes across multiple commits
- **Framework-specific IDOR detection** (v2.0) — Next.js Server Actions, Express, Fastify, Django, Rails, Go
- **Performance profiling heuristics** (v2.0) — N+1, re-renders, unbounded lists, sync blocking, bundle bloat
- **Dynamic ARIA state detection** (v2.0) — hardcoded `aria-expanded`, `aria-selected`, `aria-checked`, `aria-pressed`
- **14-pattern AI slop detection** — hallucinated imports, fake error handling, placeholder stubs, silent failures, cargo-cult patterns, fabricated comments, fake completeness
- **3-role adversarial review** — bug finder, architecture reviewer, release gate
- **Review-of-review calibration** — de-duplication, severity calibration, false positive removal
- **Fix application with validation** — apply fixes, run tests, verify
- **Report history and comparison** — track findings over time, diff between runs
- **8 project-type modules** — type-specific checklists loaded automatically
- **Local-only mode** — all analysis works offline
- **Configurable via `.ucrconfig.yml`** — project-level settings
