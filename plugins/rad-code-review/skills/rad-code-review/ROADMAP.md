# RAD Code Review — Roadmap

## v3.0 (current)

**Optimized for Claude Opus 4.7** — major platform-level upgrade, no new review dimensions. Retains full compatibility with Sonnet 4.6 and (for narrow scopes) Haiku 4.5.

- **Opus 4.7 as default primary-review model** — agent and skill both default to Opus; `--model sonnet|haiku` overrides per-run; `.ucrconfig.yml` `review_model` sets a project default.
- **Parallel tool-call pipeline** — agent Phase 1 issues Glob/Grep/Read as a single parallel batch. Orchestrator Steps 3a–3e run in parallel. Step 5 automated checks (npm audit, pip-audit, gitleaks, tsc, eslint, etc.) run concurrently via `run_in_background`. Deep reviews ~3–5× faster on Opus/Sonnet.
- **JSON-first subagent output** — primary and adversarial subagents emit structured JSON per the schema in `references/subagent-prompts/*.md`. Orchestrator parses JSON as authoritative. Markdown fallback retained for legacy resilience.
- **Compaction-safe checkpointing** — state written to `.ucr/state/<run-id>.json` after Steps 5, 7, 9. `--resume <run-id>` rehydrates mid-review and continues from the last checkpoint. Long reviews of 500+ file repos no longer lose progress when context compacts.
- **`--non-interactive` mode** — Step 10 menu is skipped; findings, verdict, and report path return as structured data. Used by the `code-reviewer` agent, `/loop` sessions, and CI integrations.
- **Externalized subagent prompts** — moved from inline in `orchestrate-review.md` Step 6/8 to `references/subagent-prompts/{primary,adversarial,self-adversarial}-review.md`. Cleaner orchestrator, easier to audit and version.
- **`.ucrconfig.yml` accepted-risk expiry enforcement** — entries with `expires < today` are surfaced as stale and re-evaluated rather than silently suppressed. Prevents permanent suppression via never-reviewed acceptances.
- **Structured JSON blame context** — Step 3f now emits a single JSON document with per-file changed ranges, blame metadata (scoped to changed lines only via `git blame -L`), and dependency edges. Replaces the prose "annotated diff context document" — smaller, more reliable, faster to produce on large diffs.
- **History filename unified** — `{YYYY-MM-DD}-{HHmmss}-{scope}-{strictness}.md` across both orchestrator and report-generation. Multiple same-day reviews no longer overwrite.
- **Cleanup** — removed vestigial `install.sh`/`install.ps1` (handled by plugin manifest) and unused `scripts/*.sh` that no workflow referenced.

## v2.1

Interactive findings menu — accept specific findings or all minor findings as intentional, persisted to `.ucrconfig.yml` with 1-year expiry and optional justification. Show-new-only mode filters the current report against `.ucr/history/` to surface only findings introduced since the last review. First-run `.ucrconfig.yml` creation with optional `.gitignore` integration.

## v2.0

Diff-aware scoping, actionable detection heuristics, and practical PR workflow support.

- Blame-aware diff scoping — `diff` and `commit` scopes only flag issues on changed lines by default, with dependency chain detection for pre-existing issues that new code depends on
- Incremental review (`--since <commit>`) — review all changes since a specific commit, with blame-aware filtering
- `--full-scan` override — opt out of blame-aware filtering to get v1.0-style full review on any scope
- Framework-specific IDOR detection — concrete grep-able mutation ownership patterns for Next.js Server Actions, Next.js API Routes, Express/Fastify, Django/DRF, Rails, and Go (Gin/Echo/Chi/net/http), plus multi-tenant isolation checks
- Performance profiling heuristics — 8 detection patterns: N+1 queries in loops, unnecessary React re-renders, unbounded list rendering, synchronous blocking in handlers, missing pagination, bundle bloat indicators, missing caching, missing database indexes
- Dynamic ARIA state detection — catches hardcoded `aria-expanded`, `aria-selected`, `aria-checked`, `aria-pressed`, and frozen `aria-hidden` as string literals instead of dynamic values
- Finding attribution — every finding tagged as `introduced`, `pre-existing-dependency`, or `pre-existing-secret` for clear signal in PR review workflows
- Adversarial blame validation — adversarial pass verifies blame-scoping decisions to catch issues that were incorrectly filtered or incorrectly included

## v1.0

The foundation. A complete, production-ready code review skill.

- Full 10-category review (functional, security, AI slop, architecture, tests, performance, UX, accessibility, release readiness, documentation)
- 8 project-type modules (web app, API, Chrome extension, CLI, library, Electron, mobile, SaaS)
- Sequential adversarial review (dual-engine mode with Claude and Codex)
- Review-of-review calibration pass
- Fix application with build/test validation
- Structured JSON report with severity-ranked findings
- Report history and comparison between runs
- `.ucrconfig.yml` project-level configuration
- GitHub Action for CI/CD (PR comments, check runs, artifact upload)
- Local-only mode (no network dependencies)
- Dependency vulnerability audit (npm, yarn, pnpm, pip, cargo, go, gem, composer)
- License compliance checking with copyleft detection
- Secrets scanning (gitleaks + pattern fallback, never exposes values)
- Cross-platform install (bash + PowerShell)

## v3.1 (planned — deferred from v2.1 roadmap)

Deeper domain-specific review capabilities.

- **Threat model mode** — Given an architecture description or diagram, enumerate attack surfaces, trust boundaries, and data flow risks. Produce a lightweight threat model alongside the code review.
- **API contract review** — Validate that implementation matches OpenAPI/Swagger schema. Detect undocumented endpoints, missing error responses, request/response type mismatches, and breaking changes between schema versions.
- **Schema/migration review** — Analyze database migrations for: data loss risk, missing rollback, index performance, constraint correctness, and compatibility with ORM models. Support for SQL migrations, Prisma, Alembic, ActiveRecord, and Flyway.
- **Infra/deploy config deep review** — Extended analysis of Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests, Terraform/Pulumi configs, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud IAM policies.
- **`security-only` strictness level** — skip architecture/UX/a11y/perf; run security + AI-slop + secrets only. Common PR-check use case.

## v4.0 (planned)

Interactive and visual review capabilities, plus extensibility.

- **Accessibility deep-dive mode** — Interactive accessibility audit using Playwright to render pages, run axe-core, check keyboard navigation, verify ARIA attributes, test screen reader compatibility, and validate color contrast.
- **UI/UX teardown mode** — Visual analysis via screenshots. Review layout consistency, spacing, typography hierarchy, interactive element sizing, loading states, error states, empty states, and responsive breakpoints.
- **Performance-focused mode** — Integrate with profiling data (Lighthouse, webpack-bundle-analyzer, py-spy, Go pprof) to correlate code patterns with measured performance characteristics.
- **Custom project-type module support** — User-defined project-type modules in `.ucr/project-types/` that extend or override built-in modules.
- **Plugin system for custom checks** — Define custom review rules as small scripts or prompt fragments.

## v5.0 (future)

Cross-service intelligence and continuous operation.

- **Multi-repo/monorepo cross-service analysis** — Review changes in context of the full service graph.
- **Runtime behavior verification integration** — Correlate code review findings with runtime data from APM tools.
- **Production incident correlation** — Given a post-mortem, trace root cause back to specific code patterns.
- **Continuous review mode** — Watch for code changes and run incremental reviews automatically.
