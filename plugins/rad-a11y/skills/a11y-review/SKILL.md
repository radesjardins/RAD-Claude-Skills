# Accessibility Review (static analysis)

Perform a structured **static analysis pass** over the specified component, page, or codebase. Execute all eight phases in order and produce an actionable, severity-ranked report with each finding tagged by confidence level.

## What this skill is — and what it isn't

This skill performs **pattern-based static analysis** over `.tsx` / `.jsx` / `.astro` / `.html` / `.css` source. It is **not** a WCAG audit, does **not** run axe-core, does **not** test runtime focus behavior, does **not** measure real contrast ratios, and does **not** test with screen readers.

**What this skill catches well (high confidence):**
- Missing `alt` on `<img>`, missing `<label>` association, missing accessible name on icon buttons
- `outline: none` / `outline-none` without a focus-visible replacement (Tailwind users — axe often misses this because it inspects computed styles)
- `aria-hidden="true"` on focusable elements or their ancestors
- Hardcoded ARIA states (`aria-expanded="true"` as a string literal, not driven by component state)
- `<div onClick>` / `<span onClick>` without role + keyboard handlers
- Skipped heading levels, missing landmarks
- React-specific focus drift (modal close handlers without focus restoration)

**What this skill flags but cannot confirm (medium confidence):**
- Color contrast — flags suspect Tailwind class combinations by name; real sRGB → WCAG ratio math and Tailwind palette parsing is not yet implemented
- ARIA state synchronization beyond the simplest cases
- Whether a `<fieldset>` correctly wraps a logical group

**What this skill cannot see at all (requires runtime / manual):**
- Whether `alt` text is *meaningful* — only checks presence and obvious anti-patterns
- Reading order matches visual order — needs DOM traversal at runtime
- Focus indicator is *sufficiently visible* — needs a browser
- Live region announcements arrive at the right time — needs real assistive tech
- Keyboard interactions feel logical to a user — needs a human
- Custom widget keyboard contracts implemented end-to-end — needs APG-pattern verification with a screen reader
- Screen reader announcement coherence — needs NVDA / JAWS / VoiceOver

For runtime verification, use `a11y-testing` to set up real axe via jest-axe and @axe-core/playwright. For manual verification, use a real screen reader.

## Audit Scope

When invoked with a path, scan that file or directory. When invoked with "all" or no argument, locate the main source directory (src/, app/, components/, pages/) and scan the full codebase.

Exclude: `node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, `.next`, `coverage`, `.astro`.

---

## Phase 0: Run validators (deterministic Python scripts)

**New in 2.1.** Before any LLM regex work, run all four rad-a11y validators in parallel. They emit JSON; their output populates the `[STATIC]` (and some `[HEURISTIC]`) findings deterministically. The LLM phases below then handle only what scripts can't decide — alt-text meaningfulness, complex ARIA logic, reading order, semantic intent — and tag those findings `[HEURISTIC]` or `[NEEDS-MANUAL]`.

**Skip Phase 0 silently if Python is unavailable** (`python3 --version` and `python --version` both fail). In that case, Phases 2–8 below run as the original LLM regex passes, with all findings tagged `[HEURISTIC]` since the deterministic backstop is missing. Note this in the report header: `⚠ Python unavailable — running in fallback mode; static patterns are heuristic.`

Execute as a single parallel Bash batch (one shell spawn for all four):

```bash
PY=$(command -v python3 || command -v python)
PR="${plugin_root}/scripts"
$PY "$PR/scan-jsx-patterns.py" "$PWD" > /tmp/rad-a11y-jsx.json &
$PY "$PR/check-tailwind-contrast.py" "$PWD" > /tmp/rad-a11y-contrast.json &
$PY "$PR/check-target-size.py" "$PWD" > /tmp/rad-a11y-target.json &
$PY "$PR/lint-aria.py" "$PWD" > /tmp/rad-a11y-aria.json &
wait
```

Then read all four JSON outputs in a parallel Read batch. Each emits the schema documented in `scripts/README.md`:

```json
{
  "tool": "...",
  "files_scanned": 42,
  "findings_count": 7,
  "findings": [ { "category": "...", "wcag": "...", "severity": "...", "confidence": "STATIC", "file": "...", "line": 12, "snippet": "...", "fix": "..." } ]
}
```

**Use the validator findings verbatim** — do not re-derive, paraphrase, or second-guess the snippet/line/category fields. They are deterministic; rewriting them adds drift. The LLM's job in Phases 2–8 is to add findings the scripts couldn't make, not to second-guess the ones they did.

If `lint-aria.py` reports `"plugin_installed": false`, surface its `recommendation` field once at the top of the report so the user knows to install `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` for higher-coverage linting.

---

## Phases 2–8: LLM-only patterns (everything scripts can't decide)

The phases below now run **after** Phase 0. They cover only what static scripts cannot determine — patterns requiring contextual judgment, cross-element analysis, or semantic intent. **Do not duplicate work the scripts already did**; if scan-jsx-patterns flagged a missing `alt`, do not re-flag it from the LLM pass. Instead, layer LLM judgment on:

- **Alt-text meaningfulness** — scripts catch missing/bad-pattern alt; LLM judges whether present alt is *informative*. Tag `[HEURISTIC]`.
- **ARIA logic in complex widgets** — scripts catch hardcoded literals; LLM judges whether ARIA states for tabs/menus/comboboxes follow the APG keyboard contract end-to-end. Tag `[HEURISTIC]`.
- **Reading order vs. visual order** — DOM-runtime concern; tag `[NEEDS-MANUAL]`.
- **Live region timing** — runtime concern; tag `[NEEDS-MANUAL]`.
- **Empty / icon-only buttons** — cross-element analysis (is there visible text in a sibling? a `sr-only` span?); tag `[HEURISTIC]`.
- **Placeholder-as-label** — cross-element (does a `<label htmlFor>` exist nearby?); tag `[HEURISTIC]`.
- **Fieldset grouping correctness** — is the group of related inputs actually wrapped? `[HEURISTIC]`.

Phases 1 (file map) and 2–8 below remain as written for the LLM-judgment slices. Phase 0 supersedes the deterministic-pattern slices that used to live inside Phases 2–8.

---

## Phase 1: Orient — Build the File Map

Before checking anything:

1. Use Glob to discover all UI files:
   - `**/*.tsx`, `**/*.jsx`, `**/*.astro` — components and pages
   - `**/*.html` — static markup
   - `**/*.css`, `**/*.scss`, `**/*.module.css` — stylesheets
   - `**/tailwind.config.*` — Tailwind configuration

2. Read `package.json` to detect the stack:
   - React / Next.js / Astro / Vue / Svelte
   - Radix UI / Headless UI / Tailwind CSS
   - Testing libraries (jest-axe, @axe-core/playwright)

3. Count total component files. Report: "Scanning X components across Y directories."

---

## Phase 2: Semantic Structure

Check every component file for semantic HTML violations.

### Heading Hierarchy (WCAG 1.3.1)
- Flag any heading that skips a level (e.g., `<h1>` → `<h3>` with no `<h2>`)
- Flag multiple `<h1>` elements on a single page
- Flag headings used purely for visual sizing (e.g., `<h4>` inside a card that is `font-bold text-sm`)
- Flag missing `<h1>` on page-level components

### Landmark Regions (WCAG 1.3.6)
- Flag pages missing `<main>`, `<header>`, `<nav>`, or `<footer>` landmarks
- Flag multiple `<nav>` or `<header>` elements that lack unique `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`
- Flag `<div id="content">` patterns that should be `<main>`

### Semantic Element Usage (WCAG 4.1.2)
- Flag `<div onClick>` and `<span onClick>` without `role` and `tabindex`
- Flag `<div role="button">` when a `<button>` should be used
- Flag `<a>` tags without `href` used as buttons
- Flag `<b>` / `<i>` used for semantic emphasis (should be `<strong>` / `<em>`)
- Flag missing `<label>` wrapping for icon-only inputs
- React: Flag wrapper `<div>` inside `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<table>` — suggest Fragments

### Images and Alt Text (WCAG 1.1.1)
- Flag `<img>` without `alt` attribute
- Flag `<img alt="image">`, `<img alt="photo">`, or file-name-as-alt anti-patterns
- Flag `<img>` with redundant alt (same as adjacent caption text)
- Flag decorative images without `alt=""` or `role="presentation"`

---

## Phase 3: ARIA Usage

Check all ARIA attribute usage across components.

### The ARIA First Principles
- **No ARIA is better than bad ARIA.** Flag every instance where ARIA overrides correct native semantics.
- Flag `role="button"` on `<button>` — redundant
- Flag `role="heading"` on `<h1>`–`<h6>` — redundant
- Flag `role="list"` on `<ul>` / `<ol>` — only needed in some browsers with Tailwind `list-none`

### aria-hidden Misuse (WCAG 1.3.1, 4.1.2)
- **Critical:** Flag `aria-hidden="true"` on any element that is focusable or contains focusable children
- Flag interactive buttons/links inside an `aria-hidden` ancestor
- Flag SVG icons missing `aria-hidden="true"` when decorative (or inside a labeled button)

### Missing Accessible Names (WCAG 4.1.2, 2.4.6)
- Flag `<button>` with no text content, no `aria-label`, and no `aria-labelledby`
- Flag icon-only buttons: `<button><svg>...</svg></button>` with no accessible name
- Flag `<a>` with no text, no `aria-label`, no `aria-labelledby`
- Flag `<input type="image">` without `alt`

### ARIA State Synchronization (WCAG 4.1.2)
- Flag `aria-expanded` attributes hardcoded to `"true"` or `"false"` that are not driven by state
- Flag disclosure components (accordions, dropdowns) missing `aria-expanded` entirely
- Flag `aria-checked`, `aria-selected`, `aria-pressed` not connected to component state
- React: Flag string literals `aria-expanded="true"` — should be `aria-expanded={isOpen}`

### Live Regions (WCAG 4.1.3)
- Flag dynamic status updates (toasts, alerts, loading states) with no `aria-live`, `role="status"`, or `role="alert"`
- Flag `role="alert"` used for non-urgent messages (should be `role="status"`)
- Flag live regions whose content is set before being added to the DOM (screen readers miss the announcement)

---

## Phase 4: Keyboard and Focus

Check keyboard operability across all interactive components.

### Focus Visibility (WCAG 2.4.7, 2.4.11)
- **Critical:** Flag any CSS with `outline: none`, `outline: 0`, or Tailwind `outline-none` that is not immediately followed by a custom focus indicator
- Flag Tailwind `focus:outline-none` without `focus-visible:ring-*` replacement
- Flag `*:focus { outline: none }` global CSS reset without a replacement

### Focus Order (WCAG 2.4.3)
- Flag `tabindex` values greater than 0 (breaks natural DOM order)
- Flag visually ordered content whose DOM order is inverted via CSS `order`, `float`, or `position: absolute`

### Keyboard Traps (WCAG 2.1.2)
- Flag custom dropdown, popover, or menu components with no `Escape` key handler
- Flag modal/dialog implementations that do not trap focus inside when open
- Flag custom components that intercept `Tab` without providing a clear exit

### Skip Links (WCAG 2.4.1)
- Flag page-level layouts that have no "Skip to main content" link
- Flag skip links present but permanently hidden (not just visually hidden until focused)

### Interactive Element Requirements (WCAG 2.1.1)
- Flag `<div role="button">` / `<div tabindex="0">` missing `keydown`/`keyup` handlers for `Enter` and `Space`
- Flag custom checkbox / radio implementations missing keyboard activation

### React-Specific Focus Drift
- Flag `useEffect` that removes a modal/panel from the DOM without calling `.focus()` on the trigger element
- Flag dialog close handlers that do not restore focus: look for `setIsOpen(false)` or `onClose()` without a preceding `triggerRef.current?.focus()`

---

## Phase 5: Color Contrast and Motion

### Contrast (WCAG 1.4.3, 1.4.11)
Check Tailwind color utility classes and CSS color values for likely contrast failures:
- Flag text on colored backgrounds where the combination is known-low-contrast (e.g., `text-gray-400 bg-white`, `text-yellow-300 bg-white`)
- Flag UI component borders/outlines that use light neutrals (`border-gray-200`, `border-gray-300`) on white backgrounds — likely fail 3:1
- Flag placeholder text (`::placeholder`) styled with low-contrast colors
- Note: Full contrast ratios require a browser tool — flag suspects, recommend using axe DevTools or Colour Contrast Analyser for verification

### Color-Only Meaning (WCAG 1.4.1)
- Flag error states indicated only by red border/text with no icon, label, or pattern
- Flag status indicators (badges, dots) that rely solely on color with no text or shape alternative
- Flag link text that is only differentiated from body text by color (no underline)

### Motion and Animation (WCAG 2.3.3)
- Flag CSS `animation` or `transition` on non-UI state changes (page decorations, hero animations) without `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` override
- Flag Tailwind animations (`animate-spin`, `animate-bounce`, `animate-pulse`) applied to non-status elements without `motion-reduce:` or `motion-safe:` modifier
- Flag auto-playing videos or carousels with no pause/stop control
- Flag content that flashes or blinks (potential seizure trigger)

### Target Size (WCAG 2.5.8 — new in 2.2)
- Flag interactive targets smaller than 24×24px — look for `w-4 h-4`, `p-0`, `text-xs` buttons that are icon-only
- Flag tightly packed link lists with less than 24px spacing between targets

---

## Phase 6: Forms

Check all form components.

### Label Association (WCAG 1.3.1, 3.3.2)
- **Critical:** Flag `<input>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>` without an associated `<label>` (via `for`/`id` or wrapping)
- Flag `htmlFor` in React that does not match an `id` on any input
- Flag `placeholder` used as the only labeling mechanism

### Required and Validation (WCAG 3.3.1, 3.3.2)
- Flag required fields with no `required` attribute or `aria-required="true"`
- Flag required indicators (asterisks) with no explanation in the form instructions
- Flag error messages that are not programmatically linked to their input via `aria-describedby`
- Flag `aria-invalid` not set to `"true"` on invalid inputs during validation

### Fieldset/Legend (WCAG 1.3.1)
- Flag groups of related checkboxes or radio buttons not wrapped in `<fieldset>` + `<legend>`
- Flag `<legend>` used but empty or containing only whitespace

---

## Phase 7: SVG and Icons

Check all SVG usage.

### Decorative SVGs (WCAG 1.1.1)
- Flag inline `<svg>` without `aria-hidden="true"` when inside a labeled button or link (screen readers will attempt to read raw SVG content)
- Flag `<svg>` without `focusable="false"` in IE/Edge-compatible codebases

### Informative SVGs (WCAG 1.1.1)
- Flag standalone SVGs (logos, charts, illustrations) without `role="img"` and either `aria-label` or a hidden text alternative
- Flag SVGs with a `<title>` but no `aria-labelledby` pointing to it (cross-browser reliability issue)

---

## Phase 8: Stack-Specific Checks

### Tailwind CSS
- Flag `outline-none` without `focus-visible:ring-*` replacement (most common Tailwind a11y failure)
- Flag missing `sr-only` on icon-only button text labels
- Confirm `motion-safe:` / `motion-reduce:` usage on animated elements
- Check for `list-none` on `<ul>` — some screen readers strip list semantics; recommend `role="list"` if semantics matter

### React
- Confirm `aria-*` props use JSX booleans correctly: `aria-expanded={isOpen}` not `aria-expanded="true"`
- Flag `key` props on focusable list items that change order (forces DOM remount, loses focus position)
- Flag `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in components — requires manual a11y verification of injected content

### Astro
- Flag islands using `client:visible` or `client:idle` on keyboard-interactive components — risk of hydration dead zones
- Recommend pre-hydrated ARIA states via `data-*` attributes for components that render with `client:visible`
- Check for skip link in the root layout (`src/layouts/*.astro`)

### Radix UI / Headless UI
- Check that `asChild` usage spreads all props and forwards refs — missing ref breaks Radix focus management
- Confirm Radix `Dialog.Content` has `aria-labelledby` pointing to `Dialog.Title`

---

## Reporting Format

Group findings into four severity levels. Report only findings with evidence. **Every finding must carry a detection-confidence tag** in addition to its severity — readers should be able to see which findings the static scan can prove and which are pattern-based heuristics or hand-offs to manual verification.

### Detection-confidence tags

- **`[STATIC]`** — Deterministic detection: the pattern is present in source and the failure mode is unambiguous from source alone. Example: `<img>` with no `alt`, `aria-hidden="true"` on a `<button>`, `outline-none` with no `focus-visible:` replacement on the same element. These are PR-blockers when they're also Critical/Serious severity.
- **`[HEURISTIC]`** — LLM judgment over patterns where source isn't dispositive. Example: "this `aria-label` looks redundant with adjacent visible text," "this `<div role="button">` *probably* needs keyboard handlers." These should be reviewed before fixing — the model can be wrong.
- **`[NEEDS-MANUAL]`** — The pattern *suggests* a problem, but only a browser, axe runtime, or screen reader can confirm. Example: contrast pair flagged by class name (no real ratio computed), live region timing, focus indicator visibility quality, alt-text meaningfulness. Surfaced so the reader knows what to verify next.

### Severity levels (orthogonal to confidence)

#### Critical (blocks PR when `[STATIC]`)
Issues that make the UI completely unusable for keyboard or screen reader users.
- Keyboard traps (no Escape, focus stuck) — `[HEURISTIC]` from source; needs runtime confirmation
- Missing focus indicators (bare `outline-none` with no replacement) — `[STATIC]`
- `aria-hidden="true"` on focusable elements — `[STATIC]`
- Interactive `<div>` with no keyboard handler — `[STATIC]`

#### Serious (fix before ship)
Issues that significantly impair assistive technology users.
- Missing form labels — `[STATIC]` (presence) / `[HEURISTIC]` (correct association)
- Icon-only buttons with no accessible name — `[STATIC]`
- Missing heading structure on pages — `[STATIC]`
- Dynamic content with no live region announcement — `[STATIC]` (missing markup) / `[NEEDS-MANUAL]` (timing)

#### Moderate (fix in next sprint)
Issues that degrade the experience for some users.
- Skipped heading levels — `[STATIC]`
- Missing skip links — `[STATIC]`
- Hardcoded ARIA states not driven by component state — `[STATIC]`
- Decorative SVGs not hidden from screen readers — `[STATIC]`

#### Minor (best practice)
Low-impact issues or recommendations.
- Missing `lang` on `<html>` — `[STATIC]`
- Generic link text ("click here", "read more") — `[HEURISTIC]`
- `tabindex > 0` values — `[STATIC]`
- Missing `aria-label` on duplicate landmarks — `[STATIC]`

For each finding, output:
```
[SEVERITY] [CONFIDENCE] WCAG X.X.X — Short description
File: path/to/file.tsx:line
Code: <the problematic snippet>
Fix: Specific remediation
[Notes: <any caveat — e.g., "real contrast ratio not computed; verify with axe DevTools">]
```

### End-of-report summary

Do **not** issue a Pass / Fail / Compliance verdict. Static analysis cannot produce a defensible WCAG 2.2 AA pass/fail — that requires runtime + manual + assistive-tech verification. Instead, end with:

```
Static scan summary
-------------------
[STATIC]      findings: <N> Critical, <N> Serious, <N> Moderate, <N> Minor
[HEURISTIC]   findings: <N> total — review before fixing, model can be wrong
[NEEDS-MANUAL] flags:    <N> total — verify with axe DevTools / screen reader

Top 3 priority fixes (highest severity × highest confidence):
  1. <file:line> — <description>
  2. <file:line> — <description>
  3. <file:line> — <description>

Recommended next steps:
  - Set up real axe runtime (use the a11y-testing skill) — covers categories static scan can't
  - Manual screen reader pass on <list any [NEEDS-MANUAL] flagged components>
  - Browser-based contrast verification on <list any color-related [NEEDS-MANUAL] flags>
```

## What real axe / Lighthouse catches that this skill doesn't, and vice versa

Real axe (running in a browser via jest-axe or @axe-core/playwright) catches a different subset than this static skill. They overlap heavily but each catches things the other misses.

**Real axe catches but this static skill cannot:**
- Computed contrast ratios (real sRGB → WCAG math against rendered colors)
- Duplicate `id` after dynamic component rendering
- ARIA attribute validity against the resolved role
- Some keyboard accessibility paths that depend on runtime DOM

**This static skill catches but real axe often misses:**
- Tailwind `outline-none` written without a `focus-visible:ring-*` replacement (axe sees the resolved `:focus` style, which may have a default UA outline depending on browser/version, leading to false negatives)
- Hardcoded ARIA state literals in JSX source (`aria-expanded="true"` as a string instead of `={isOpen}`) — axe sees the value at the moment of scan, missing the bug that the value never updates
- React modal close handlers that don't restore focus to the trigger (axe sees the focus state after close, but the underlying source pattern is invisible to it)
- Astro `client:visible` / `client:idle` on keyboard-interactive components (hydration timing issues)

The honest framing: **`/a11y-review` and real axe are complementary, not redundant.** Run both. The widely-cited "axe catches 30–80%" range refers to real axe — `/a11y-review` covers a subset of that range plus some patterns axe misses, which is why every finding here is tagged with detection confidence so you know what you actually have.
