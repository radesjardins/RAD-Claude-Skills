## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add radesjardins/RAD-Claude-Skills
/plugin install rad-1password@rad-claude-skills
```

## Requirements

- 1Password CLI v2.x — `op --version` (verified against v2.34.0)
- For interactive use: 1Password desktop app with **Settings > Developer > Integrate with 1Password CLI** enabled, plus biometric unlock (Touch ID / Windows Hello / system auth)
- For headless / CI: a service account token in `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN`

## Coverage notes

All 8 commands and 11 management commands documented at <https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/reference/> are covered. `op environment` is **beta-only** and not available in stable v2.x — the skills note this and direct users to in-app management instead. Flag and example info was cross-checked against `op --help` on a v2.34.0 install rather than only against the docs site.
