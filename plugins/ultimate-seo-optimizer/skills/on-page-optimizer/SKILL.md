name: on-page-optimizer
description: >
  Performs a deep on-page SEO audit of a specific page — analyzing title tags, meta
  descriptions, heading hierarchy, keyword usage, content quality, E-E-A-T signals,
  image alt text, internal linking, and AEO-ready formatting. Scores the page 0-100
  and provides fix commands. Use when the user wants to optimize a particular page or
  URL for search, improve a page's rankings for specific keywords, audit on-page
  elements across a page, check E-E-A-T compliance, evaluate content quality for SEO,
  or asks "why isn't this page ranking?" or "how do I improve this page's SEO?" This
  skill handles multi-element page-level optimization, not single quick fixes. This is
  NOT for: updating just one meta tag in isolation, writing new content from scratch,
  site-wide audits (use full-seo-audit), keyword research (use keyword-discovery),
  generating schema markup (use schema-architect), or non-SEO content writing.

| H1 content             | Contains the primary keyword                                     |
| Hierarchy              | Logical H2-H6 nesting, no skipped levels (e.g., H2 then H4)    |
| H2 format              | Section summaries or questions (AEO-friendly)                    |

```

## 4. Content Quality Scoring

Score each page on a **0-100 scale** using six dimensions. Each dimension is worth up to
~17 points. A page scoring below 70 needs improvement; below 50 is critical.

| Dimension        | Weight | What to Evaluate                                               |
|------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Depth            | 17     | Covers the topic comprehensively; no obvious gaps              |
| Originality      | 17     | Unique insights, proprietary data, or fresh perspectives       |
| Readability      | 17     | Short paragraphs, bullet lists, visuals, clear language        |
| Intent match     | 17     | Satisfies the search intent for the target keyword             |
| Freshness        | 16     | Information is current; published/updated dates are visible    |
| Keyword usage    | 16     | Natural placement at 1-2% density; no stuffing                 |

### Audit Checklist

1. **Depth** -- Compare word count and subtopics against the top 5 ranking pages.
2. **Originality** -- Flag if content closely paraphrases competitor pages with no new data.
3. **Readability** -- Paragraphs > 4 sentences? Missing lists or visuals? Flag them.
4. **Intent match** -- Identify the keyword's intent (informational, transactional, navigational)
   and verify the page format matches.
5. **Freshness** -- Check for a visible published or "last updated" date. Flag if older than
   12 months or missing entirely.
6. **Keyword usage** -- Calculate keyword density. Flag if < 0.5% (under-optimized) or
   > 2.5% (stuffing).

### Fix Commands

```bash
# Score a page's content quality
claude "Analyze /src/pages/guide.html for content quality. Score it 0-100 across depth, originality, readability, intent match, freshness, and keyword usage. Show the breakdown and specific improvement actions."

# Fix keyword density
claude "In /src/pages/guide.html, the keyword 'email marketing' appears at 0.3% density. Add 4-6 natural mentions in existing paragraphs to reach 1-1.5% density without stuffing."

# Improve readability
claude "In /src/pages/guide.html, break any paragraph longer than 4 sentences into shorter ones. Add bullet lists where 3+ items are listed in prose."
```

## 5. E-E-A-T Assessment

Reference: `eeat-checklist.md` for the full scoring rubric.

### The Four Pillars

| Pillar             | Key Signals                                                        |

| **Experience**     | First-hand evidence: personal photos, case studies, "I tested"     |
| **Expertise**      | Author credentials visible: bio, qualifications, certifications    |
| **Authoritativeness** | Site recognition: awards, media mentions, backlink profile       |
| **Trustworthiness**   | HTTPS, accurate info, transparency, clear contact details        |

### Audit Checklist

1. **Author bio** -- Confirm every article has an author bio with name, credentials, photo,
   and links to professional profiles.
2. **About Us page** -- Verify it exists, describes the organization's mission, and lists
   team credentials.
3. **Citations** -- At least 3 outbound links to authoritative sources per 1,000 words.
4. **Dates** -- Published and "last updated" dates are visible on every content page.
5. **YMYL check** -- If the page covers health, finance, legal, or safety topics, apply
   heightened standards: medical review, professional credentials, disclaimers.
6. **Experience signals** -- Look for original photos, screenshots, personal anecdotes,
   or case study data that prove first-hand experience.
7. **Trust signals** -- HTTPS active, privacy policy linked, contact page accessible,
   no deceptive ads or popups.

```

### Fix Commands

# Add lazy loading

### Audit Checklist

2. List all anchor text. Flag generic text ("click here", "read more", "this page").
3. Verify every supporting page links to its pillar/hub page.

## Full-Page Optimization Workflow

Run these steps in order for a complete on-page audit:

```bash
# Step 1 -- Audit everything at once
claude "Run a full on-page SEO audit on /src/pages/target-page.html for the keyword 'target keyword'. Check: title tag (50-60 chars, keyword front-loaded), meta description (150-160 chars, CTA), heading structure (single H1, no skipped levels, H2s as questions), content quality (score 0-100), E-E-A-T signals, image optimization, internal links (3+ per page), and AEO formatting. Output a prioritized list of issues with severity (critical/warning/info)."

# Step 2 -- Apply all fixes
claude "Apply every critical and warning fix identified in the audit of /src/pages/target-page.html. Preserve existing content meaning while optimizing structure, meta tags, headings, images, and links."

# Step 3 -- Verify
claude "Re-audit /src/pages/target-page.html and confirm all critical and warning issues are resolved. Show the before and after content quality score."
