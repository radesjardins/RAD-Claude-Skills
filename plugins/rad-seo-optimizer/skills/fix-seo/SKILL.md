## Common Quick Fixes

### Missing Meta Descriptions
```
Scan every page for missing or duplicate meta descriptions. Add unique, 150-160 character
descriptions that include the target keyword and a call to action.
```

### Heading Hierarchy
```
Check every page for exactly one H1, logical H2-H6 nesting, no skipped levels. Fix any
violations while preserving content meaning.
```

### Missing Alt Text
```
Find every <img> missing an alt attribute. Add descriptive alt text that includes the
page's target keyword where natural. Keep each under 125 characters.
```

### Missing Schema Markup
```
Identify page type and generate appropriate JSON-LD schema. At minimum: Organization on
homepage, Article/BlogPosting on blog posts, BreadcrumbList on all pages.
```

### Broken Internal Links
```
Crawl all internal <a href> references and verify targets exist. Update or remove broken
links. Check for redirect chains and flatten them.
```

### Slow Page Speed
```
Check for render-blocking resources, unoptimized images, missing lazy loading, and
excessive third-party scripts. Apply fixes appropriate to the detected framework.
```

### Robots.txt Issues
```
Read robots.txt and verify no important paths are blocked. Ensure sitemap directive is
present. Remove overly broad wildcard rules.
```

## Fix Verification

After applying any fix, verify:

- The fix resolves the original issue.
- No new issues were introduced.
- The page still renders correctly.
- Any schema changes are valid JSON-LD.
- Internal links still resolve to 200 status codes.

Report the before and after state to the user with a summary of changes made.
