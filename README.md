# RAD Claude Skills

A curated marketplace of plugins for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) — Anthropic's agentic coding tool. The lineup focuses on capabilities that add value beyond Opus 4.7's baseline competence: workflow lifecycle, MCP-backed live operations, structured planning, honest AI-pattern auditing, and domain-specific tools where they earn their place.

Install everything at once or cherry-pick individual plugins.

> **May 2026 — marketplace v1.12.0 (14 plugins).** Two retirements in this window: **rad-website-design** (v1.12.0 — static-analysis surface overlapped with rad-a11y already in the marketplace; runtime path was already delegated to chrome-devtools-mcp), and **rad-writer** as a plugin (v1.11.0 — project-narrative role moved to rad-explain 0.1.0's `narrate-project` + `ground-readme` for any repo, and rad-planner 4.4's `/project-story` for canonical-doc projects; the Claude.ai skill at `skills/rad-writer/` is preserved as a standalone distribution). One new plugin: **rad-explain 0.1.0** (5 skills + 2 pure-stdlib Python validators — `check-grounding` and `check-overpromise` — gate every output). rad-planner shipped 4.1 → 4.5 in this window: **conversational by design** (4.1, M1–M5 require explicit user input regardless of harness autonomy hints; opt-in `--auto` produces DRAFT strawmen and does NOT write ADRs), **M0.5 scope-confirmation hard gate** on ALL entry points and modes including `--auto` (4.2), **prose-first briefing pattern** at M0.5 + free-form continuation triggers (4.3), `/project-story` + `/refresh-story` synthesis skills (4.4), `--assessment` read-only diagnostic flag (4.5). rad-session shipped 5.2 → 5.3: **permission-mode-safe** asymmetry-of-downside split between `/startup` Case C (data-loss-protected, always prompts) and `/wrapup --auto` (writes DRAFT-banner ADRs so captures aren't lost); **floor of one line on `/startup`** so silent completion can't violate the doorman model.
>
> **Earlier — April 2026.** Single-framework reviewer plugins (rad-react, rad-zod, rad-typescript, rad-nextjs, rad-fastify, rad-astro, rad-stripe-fastify-webhooks) archived — Opus 4.7 handles those well enough on its own. **rad-stack-guide** archived — stack-detection value absorbed into rad-session 5.1's `/startup` Phase 0.5 (originally `/init`, folded after a name conflict with Claude Code's built-in). **rad-google-workspace** (93 skills) archived — superseded by [`rad-gws-core`](plugins/rad-gws-core/) (14 essential skills). All archived plugins preserved under [`archive/`](archive/). The remaining 14 plugins are the ones that demonstrably add value Opus doesn't already provide.

## Plugins vs Skills — Two Formats, Two Environments

You'll notice some names appear in both `plugins/` and `skills/` (`rad-brainstormer`, plus `rad-seo-optimizer` ↔ `rad-seo-aeo-reviewer`), and that `rad-writer` lives only under `skills/`. They cover the same knowledge but are built for different environments:

**`plugins/` — Claude Code CLI & Claude Desktop**
Full plugin bundles with multiple skills, autonomous agents, reference files, and automatic routing. They activate when you're working in a Claude Code session — they can read your filesystem, spawn subagents, and chain tools together. Install with `claude plugins add`.

**`skills/` — Claude.ai (the web app)**
Single-file skills designed for [claude.ai](https://claude.ai). They work as uploadable ZIP files via **Settings > Customize > Skills**, as Project Knowledge, or as conversation attachments. They consolidate plugin knowledge into one skill, use web search and URL fetching instead of filesystem tools, and output deliverables as artifacts. No CLI needed.

Two plugins have Claude.ai counterparts: `rad-brainstormer` and `rad-seo-optimizer` (as `rad-seo-aeo-reviewer`). A third Claude.ai skill, `rad-writer`, is distributed standalone — the matching plugin was retired in v1.11.0 (its project-narrative role moved to `rad-explain` and `rad-planner`'s `/project-story`). The table column **Works with** shows which environments each plugin supports.

---

## Why These Plugins?

Claude Code is powerful out of the box — but it doesn't know which MCP servers your project has wired up, which review patterns catch AI-generated mistakes in your specific framework, or how to deterministically validate the implementation plan it just generated. These plugins add value Opus 4.7 doesn't provide on its own: deterministic validators (Python scripts), MCP-backed live operations, structured workflow lifecycle, and domain-specific tools.

Each one installs in a single command and activates automatically when you ask Claude about relevant topics. No configuration, no manual invocation — just better answers for the specific problems they were built for. Use any plugin on its own, or run **`/rad-session:startup`** in a new project — on first run it bootstraps the project (detects your stack, asks once which agents are in scope, scaffolds the operating manual + status.md + profile) and recommends which other rad-* plugins fit; subsequent runs are a read-only briefing.

---

## Quick Install

### Option 1: Add as a Marketplace (recommended)

Add the entire marketplace to Claude Code or Claude Desktop — browse and install any plugin, with automatic updates on sync.

```bash
# Add the marketplace
claude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/radesjardins/RAD-Claude-Skills

# Install any plugin from the marketplace
claude plugin install rad-session@rad-claude-skills
claude plugin install rad-code-review@rad-claude-skills
claude plugin install rad-planner@rad-claude-skills
# ... any plugin from the list below

# Update all installed plugins
claude plugin marketplace update
```

### Option 2: Install Directly from Git

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/radesjardins/RAD-Claude-Skills.git

# Install any plugin
claude plugins add ./RAD-Claude-Skills/plugins/rad-session
claude plugins add ./RAD-Claude-Skills/plugins/rad-code-review
claude plugins add ./RAD-Claude-Skills/plugins/rad-planner
# ... any plugin from the list below
```

### Verify Installation

Start a new Claude Code session and run:
```
/skills
```

## Where to Start

Not sure which plugins to install first? These four deliver the most value across the widest range of projects:

| Plugin | Why install it | Works with |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| [rad-session](plugins/rad-session/) | **5.3** — Three-skill session lifecycle (`/startup`, `/wrapup`, `/add-resource`) with cross-machine continuity. `/startup` orients each session — Phase 0 fetches origin and prompts to pull when behind, Phase 0.5 bootstraps on first run (stack detection, agent_scope question, operating-manual scaffold per sectioned-writer rule with rad-planner, plugin-bloat audit), Phase 1.5 gap-checks strategic docs. **Floor of one line on `/startup`** (v5.3) — silent completion violates the doorman model. `/wrapup` writes `docs/status.md` from evidence (git diff, test output, plan-task state); Phase 3 prompts to append tagged decisions to `docs/decisions/` as ADRs (`--auto` mode writes DRAFT-banner ADRs so captures aren't lost). **Permission-mode-safe** (v5.2) — operations split by asymmetry of downside. | CLI, Desktop |
| [rad-code-review](plugins/rad-code-review/) | **4.1** — Catches bugs, AI anti-patterns, and security issues in your current diff. Blame-aware scoping, framework-specific IDOR (6 frameworks), AI slop detection (14 patterns), performance heuristics, 3 review roles. Language- and framework-agnostic. | CLI, Desktop |
| [rad-planner](plugins/rad-planner/) | **4.5** — Plan-first project planning, **conversational by design**. Five-phase conversation (Constitution & Frame → Goal-Backward Scope → Sequence with Size Discipline → Quality Gates → Doc-Set Recommendation) produces the plan; M6 executes the approved doc set per the canonical structure at [`docs/doc-conventions.md`](docs/doc-conventions.md). Six mode flags: `--full`, `--improve`, `--drift`, `--pivot`, `--validate`, `--assessment` (NEW in 4.5: read-only state-of-project diagnostic, no plan required, no writes), plus opt-in `--auto` for DRAFT strawmen. M0.5 scope-confirmation hard gate fires on ALL entry points and modes. Four mechanical validators back the workflow: `plan-lint.py`, `status-validator.py`, `doc-redundancy.py`, `doc-contradiction.py`. Two project-story synthesis skills (`/project-story`, `/refresh-story`) generate narrative views from the canonical doc set. | CLI, Desktop |
| [rad-explain](plugins/rad-explain/) | **0.1.0** — Honest project explanation for any repo. Five skills (`narrate-project`, `elevator-pitch`, `draft-pitch`, `explain-document`, `ground-readme`) generate audience-targeted external communications from internal artifacts. Two pure-stdlib Python validators (`check-grounding`, `check-overpromise`) run on every output — claims must trace to repo source; superlatives, vague-quantity, marketing fluff, and production-readiness assertions get flagged. No rad-planner dependency; works on any repo. | CLI, Desktop |

After installing rad-session, run `/rad-session:startup` in your project — on first run, it bootstraps the project (stack detection, agent scope, operating manual scaffold, status.md scaffold, profile creation) and recommends which other rad-* plugins fit (no auto-install, just informed recommendations). Subsequent runs are a quick read-only briefing.

---

## Plugin Pipelines

Some plugins are designed to chain. The most common pipeline for a new project:

1. **[rad-brainstormer](plugins/rad-brainstormer/)** — explore the problem space, converge on an idea, produce a design spec (`/rad-brainstormer:brainstorm-session` → `/rad-brainstormer:design-sprint`)
2. **[rad-planner](plugins/rad-planner/)** — turn the spec into a project plan via the five-phase plan-first conversation. Four entry points (`/plan --full`, `--improve`, `--drift`, `--pivot`); M6 writes the approved doc set per [`docs/doc-conventions.md`](docs/doc-conventions.md). Four mechanical validators (`plan-lint`, `status-validator`, `doc-redundancy`, `doc-contradiction`) back the workflow.
3. **[rad-session](plugins/rad-session/)** — `/startup` orients each session; on first run for a project, its Phase 0.5 bootstrap populates the operating manual's Operational sections (Commands, Compact Instructions, Claude-specific behavior) — rad-planner 4.0 already wrote the Constitution sections. `/wrapup` captures state and prompts for ADR additions.
4. **[rad-code-review](plugins/rad-code-review/)** — review the code you generate from the plan (`/rad-code-review`)

Each plugin stands alone — the pipeline is a suggestion, not a requirement. The boundary between `design-sprint` and `plan` is: design-sprint produces a *spec* (architecture, components, APIs), plan produces an *ordered implementation plan* (DAG, tasks, complexity, risk) plus the 8-doc strategic/operational set.

## Plugins

### Workflow & Code Quality

| Plugin | Skills | Agents | What It Does | Works with |
|--------|--------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| [rad-session](plugins/rad-session/) | 3 | 0 | **5.3** — Three-skill session lifecycle (`/startup`, `/wrapup`, `/add-resource`). `/startup` orients each session — Phase 0 fetches origin and prompts to pull when behind; Phase 0.5 bootstraps on first run (stack detection, agent_scope question, operating-manual scaffold per sectioned-writer rule with rad-planner, plugin-bloat audit); Phase 1.5 gap-checks strategic docs. **Floor of one line on `/startup`** (v5.3) — silent completion violates the doorman model; routine confirmation line includes status freshness + plan progress + pointer to `docs/status.md`. `/wrapup` writes `docs/status.md` from EVIDENCE (git diff, test output, plan-task state) and Phase 3 prompts to append tagged decisions to `docs/decisions/` as ADRs; `--auto` mode writes DRAFT-banner ADRs so captures aren't lost. **Permission-mode-safe** (v5.2) — `/startup` Phase 0.5 Case C guard rail is data-loss-protected (prompts regardless of Auto/Bypass/`--non-interactive`); `/wrapup --auto` is productively autonomous. PreCompact safety net. **Built for rad-planner 4.x's canonical doc structure** ([`docs/doc-conventions.md`](docs/doc-conventions.md)) — owns `docs/status.md`, reads `docs/planning/current.md` written by rad-planner. | CLI, Desktop |
| [rad-code-review](plugins/rad-code-review/) | 1 | 1 | **4.1** — Diff-aware adversarial code review. Blame-aware scoping, framework-specific IDOR (6 frameworks), AI slop detection (14 patterns), performance heuristics, 3 review roles. Language- and framework-agnostic. | CLI, Desktop |
| [rad-planner](plugins/rad-planner/) | 7 | 3 | **4.5** — Plan-first project planning, **conversational by design** (v4.1: M1–M5 require explicit user input regardless of harness autonomy hints; opt-in `--auto` produces DRAFT strawmen and does NOT write ADRs). M0.5 scope-confirmation hard gate (v4.2) fires after M0 discovery and BEFORE any substantive work on ALL entry points and ALL modes including `--auto` — autonomy applies to the work, not to the scope decision. M0.5 renders as a prose-first briefing (v4.3) matching rad-session's `/startup` doorman pattern: **Where we left off** + **Last accomplishment** + **Next logical step** + **Or you could start with** + a single Mechanical state line for identifiers. `/plan` runs six mode flags: `--full`, `--improve`, `--drift`, `--pivot`, `--validate`, `--assessment` (NEW in 4.5: read-only state-of-project diagnostic, no plan required, no writes), plus `--auto`. Five-phase conversation (Constitution & Frame → Goal-Backward Scope → Sequence with Size Discipline → Quality Gates → Doc-Set Recommendation) produces the plan; M6 executes the approved doc set per the canonical structure. Two project-story synthesis skills (`/project-story`, `/refresh-story` — v4.4) derive plain-language narrative views from the canonical doc set. Four mechanical validators back the workflow: `plan-lint.py`, `status-validator.py`, `doc-redundancy.py`, `doc-contradiction.py`. Plus `validate-json.py` for subagent JSON contracts. | CLI, Desktop |
| [rad-a11y](plugins/rad-a11y/) | 6 | 1 | WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility — 4 reference skills (semantic HTML, ARIA, keyboard/focus, forms), 1 setup skill (a11y-testing wires up real axe via jest-axe + Playwright), 1 static-analysis skill (a11y-review) + autonomous reviewer agent. **2.0 honesty pass:** every finding tagged `[STATIC]` / `[HEURISTIC]` / `[NEEDS-MANUAL]`; no Pass/Fail compliance verdict. **2.1 mechanical validators:** 4 pure-stdlib Python scripts (scan-jsx-patterns, check-tailwind-contrast with real WCAG sRGB math, check-target-size for WCAG 2.5.8, lint-aria wrapping eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y) run in Phase 0 before LLM judgment. **2.2 cross-model + stack-aware:** Phase 0 + Phase 1 issued as a single parallel tool-call burst on Opus 4.7/Sonnet 4.6 (Haiku falls back gracefully); Phase 8 stack slices only execute when detected stack matches (React/Next/Astro/Tailwind/Radix/Headless UI), plain HTML projects skip Phase 8 entirely. | CLI, Desktop |
| [rad-chrome-extension](plugins/rad-chrome-extension/) | 9 | 1 | Chrome MV3 extensions — WXT, React, security, messaging, storage, service workers, CWS compliance | CLI, Desktop |

### Productivity & Content

| Plugin | Skills | Agents | What It Does | Works with |
|--------|--------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| [rad-seo-optimizer](plugins/rad-seo-optimizer/) | 12 | 3 | Full SEO toolkit — site audits, AEO/AI visibility, keyword research, competitor analysis, link building, schema, technical SEO | CLI, Desktop, Claude.ai |
| [rad-brainstormer](plugins/rad-brainstormer/) | 10 | 3 | Structured ideation — SCAMPER, Six Hats, Five Whys, reverse brainstorming, design sprints, pre-mortem analysis | CLI, Desktop, Claude.ai |
| [rad-explain](plugins/rad-explain/) | 5 | 0 | **0.1.0** — Honest project explanation. Five skills (`narrate-project`, `elevator-pitch`, `draft-pitch`, `explain-document`, `ground-readme`) generate audience-targeted external communications from a project's internal artifacts. Two pure-stdlib Python validators (`check-grounding`, `check-overpromise`) gate every output — claims must trace to repo source, superlatives + vague-quantity + marketing fluff + unsupported production-readiness get flagged. Works on any repo; reads canonical `docs/` if present, falls back to README + manifest + source structure. Pairs with `/rad-planner:project-story` for canonical-doc-set projects. | CLI, Desktop |
| [rad-para-second-brain](plugins/rad-para-second-brain/) | 5 | 2 | PARA second brain — organize notes, run weekly reviews, progressive summarization, session handoffs, 12 favorite problems | CLI, Desktop |
| [rad-context-prompter](plugins/rad-context-prompter/) | 2 | 1 | Prompt engineering — write, debug, and optimize prompts for 30+ AI platforms. Includes decompiler for reverse-engineering existing prompts | CLI, Desktop |

### Backend & Infrastructure

| Plugin | Skills | Agents | What It Does | Works with |
|--------|--------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| [rad-supabase](plugins/rad-supabase/) | 11 | 1 | Full-stack Supabase — local CLI workflows, MCP remote operations, RLS, migrations, auth, storage, edge functions, branching | CLI, Desktop |
| [rad-coolify-orchestrator](plugins/rad-coolify-orchestrator/) | 8 | 1 | Coolify self-hosted PaaS — deployments, databases, security, CI/CD, troubleshooting, observability, infrastructure. **2.0 ships 4 Python validators** (lint-dockerfile, lint-compose, check-coolify-env, audit-cicd) the coolify-reviewer agent runs before LLM judgment. Honest about what's experimental (Sentinel scope, Swarm, Caddy proxy, Railpack-NOT-yet-shipped). Bundles [`@radoriginllc/coolify-mcp`](packages/coolify-mcp/) (27 verified tools). | CLI, Desktop |
| [rad-1password](plugins/rad-1password/) | 11 | 0 | End-to-end coverage of the 1Password CLI (`op`) — so Claude can use your secrets without you ever pasting plaintext into chat. Seven auto-triggered routers (`1password-cli`, `op-secrets-injection`, `op-item-management`, `op-provisioning`, `op-ssh-keys`, `op-shell-plugins`, `op-service-accounts`) plus four utility slash commands (`/op-signin`, `/op-status`, `/op-find`, `/op-secret-template`). All 8 commands and 11 management commands documented at the 1Password CLI reference are covered; flags cross-checked against `op --help` on v2.34.0. Honest about beta scope (`op environment` is beta-only and directed to in-app management). Requires 1Password CLI v2.x; biometric unlock or service-account token. | CLI, Desktop |

### Google Workspace

| Plugin | Skills | Agents | What It Does | Works with |
|--------|--------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| [rad-gws-core](plugins/rad-gws-core/) | 14 | 0 | Google Workspace essentials — Gmail send/read/reply/triage, Docs write, Sheets read/append, Slides, Drive, Calendar. Requires `gws` CLI. The wider 93-skill `rad-google-workspace` was archived in April 2026 (see [archive/](archive/)). | CLI, Desktop |

---

## Claude.ai Skills

Three standalone skills packaged for [claude.ai](https://claude.ai). Import as a ZIP via **Settings > Customize > Skills**, add to a Project, or attach to any conversation. Two are Claude.ai counterparts of marketplace plugins (`rad-brainstormer`, `rad-seo-optimizer` → `rad-seo-aeo-reviewer`); one is Claude.ai-only after the matching plugin was retired (`rad-writer` — see the v1.11.0 retirement note above).

| Skill | Source | ZIP | What It Does |
|-------|--------|-----|-------------|
| [rad-writer](skills/rad-writer/) | Claude.ai-only (plugin retired v1.11.0) | `rad-writer.zip` | Domain-aware writing and editorial review across 9 content types, AI pattern avoidance, voice profiling |
| [rad-brainstormer](skills/rad-brainstormer/) | Counterpart of rad-brainstormer plugin | `rad-brainstormer.zip` | Facilitated ideation, SCAMPER/Six Hats/Five Whys, pre-mortem analysis, design sprint |
| [rad-seo-aeo-reviewer](skills/rad-seo-aeo-reviewer/) | Counterpart of rad-seo-optimizer plugin | `rad-seo-aeo-reviewer.zip` | SEO audit (URL or GitHub mode), competitor research, content strategy, AI search visibility |

See [`skills/README.md`](skills/README.md) for import instructions and how these differ from the plugin versions.

---

## How It Works

Once installed, skills activate automatically when you ask Claude about relevant topics. Each skill has specific **trigger phrases** — natural language patterns that tell Claude when to use that skill.

For example, with `rad-a11y` installed:
```
You: "Is this component accessible?"
Claude: [activates a11y-review skill, runs WCAG 2.2 AA review]

You: "Set up axe-core testing for my project"
Claude: [activates a11y-testing skill, scaffolds CI integration]
```

With `rad-seo-optimizer` installed:
```
You: /seo-audit https://mysite.com
Claude: [runs 6-phase SEO audit with scored report]

You: "How do I get recommended by ChatGPT?"
Claude: [activates aeo-optimizer skill, analyzes AI search visibility]
```

See each plugin's README for its full list of trigger phrases.
